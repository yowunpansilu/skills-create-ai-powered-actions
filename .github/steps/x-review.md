## Review

_Congratulations, you've completed this exercise and learned how to create AI-powered GitHub Actions!_

Here's a recap of your accomplishments:

- **Created action metadata** (`action.yml`) defining inputs, outputs, and other metadata fields
- **Created JavaScript source files** implementing an AI-powered joke rating action and leveraged GitHub Models for analysis
- **Tested your action** locally using VS Code debugging tools and open source libraries for local GitHub Actions testing
- **Implemented structured outputs** using Zod schemas for reliable data processing and conditional workflow logic
- **Authored a GitHub Actions workflow** that triggers on issue comments and updates them with the results of your action

### What's next?

- Check out the other [GitHub Skills exercises](https://learn.github.com/skills).
- Enhance your action by refactoring it to expose individual outputs instead of a single JSON output for easier consumption in workflows!

- **Create your next action** using GitHub's template repositories with best practices like tests and linting already built-in:
  - [actions/javascript-action](https://github.com/actions/javascript-action) template repository
  - [actions/typescript-action](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action) template repository
